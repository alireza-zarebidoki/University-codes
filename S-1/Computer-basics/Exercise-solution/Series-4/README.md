## 💡 Key Concepts Used
In this series, I expanded my knowledge to complex data structures:
* **2D Arrays:** Working with Matrices, Rows, and Columns (`arr[i][j]`).
* **Strings:** Handling text, `char` arrays, and null-terminators (`\0`).
* **Nested Loops:** Using double or triple loops for matrix operations.
* **Pattern Logic:** Algorithms for specific traversals (like Spiral or Diagonal).
