## 💡 Key Concepts Used
In this series, I focused on controlling the flow of the program:
* **Conditionals:** Using `if-else` and `switch-case` for branching logic.
* **Loops:** Implementing `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for repetition.
* **Logic:** Building complex conditions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
* **Math:** Implementing geometric formulas (Slope) and number theory (Perfect numbers).
