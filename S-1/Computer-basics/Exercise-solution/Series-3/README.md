## 💡 Key Concepts Used
In this series, I mastered data manipulation using Arrays:
* **Array Declaration:** Defining static arrays (`int arr[100]`).
* **Indexing:** Accessing elements via `arr[i]` and boundary checking.
* **Traversal:** Using loops (`for`, `while`) to iterate through data.
* **Search Logic:** Linear search for duplicates or specific conditions (peaks).
