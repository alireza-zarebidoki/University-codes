## 🧠 Topics Covered

My codes in this repository cover the following concepts:

1.  **Basics:** Flowcharts, Variables, Data Types, Input/Output (`printf`/`scanf`, `cin`/`cout`).
2.  **Control Flow:** Conditionals (`if-else`, `switch`) and Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
3.  **Functions:** Modular programming, Recursion, and Scope.
4.  **Data Structures:** 1D & 2D Arrays, Strings, and Structs.
5.  **Memory Management:** Pointers, References, and Dynamic Allocation.
6.  **Algorithms:** Basic Sorting (Bubble, Selection) and Searching (Linear, Binary).
