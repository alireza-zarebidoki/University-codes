# 🎓 University Projects & Code Snippets

Welcome to my academic coding repository! Here, I document my journey through the **Computer Science** curriculum at **Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (FUM)**.

This repository serves as an archive for my assignments, practice codes, and algorithm implementations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codes are organized by topic to showcase specific skills:
